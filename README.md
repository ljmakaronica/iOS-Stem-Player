# iOS Stem Player
A full-stack application that splits music tracks into individual stems (vocals, drums, bass, other) and provides an intuitive interface for real-time mixing and playback control. Currently for development and educational purposes only - not available on the App Store. Requires local setup of Python backend and iOS development environment to run.

## Technical Stack
### Backend (Python/Flask)
- Flask server with CORS support
- yt-dlp for YouTube audio extraction
- Demucs for stem separation
- Background task processing
- RESTful API endpoints
- File management system
- Status tracking and cleanup routines

### iOS Frontend (Swift/UIKit)
- Custom UI components with animations
- AVFoundation for audio playback
- Background processing management
- Persistent storage handling
- Touch gesture recognition
- Real-time audio mixing
- State management and synchronization

## Requirements
### Backend
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages:
  - flask
  - flask-cors
  - yt-dlp
  - demucs
  - pydub
- FFmpeg (for audio processing)

### Frontend
- Xcode 14+
- iOS 15.0+
- macOS for development

## Getting Started
1. Set up the Python backend:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Install FFmpeg (if not already installed):
   - macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
   - Linux: `apt-get install ffmpeg`
   - Windows: Download from FFmpeg website

3. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

4. iOS Setup:
   - Open Xcode and create a new project
   - Copy the Swift files into your project
   - Find your computer's IP address:
     - macOS: System Preferences â†’ Network
     - Usually looks like: 192.168.1.xxx
   - Update `baseURL` in `MenuViewController.swift`:
     ```swift
     private let baseURL = "http://YOUR_IP_HERE:5001"
     ```
   - Build and run the iOS application

## Usage
1. Launch the app
2. Paste a YouTube URL
3. Wait for processing (you'll receive a notification when complete)
4. Tap the processed song to download stems
5. Use the mixer interface to control individual stems
